# Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet – Solutions & Notes

📘 This is an open-source repository containing my solutions and notes to problems from **Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet**.

The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey through structured DSA practice — and to create a resource that others can also learn from, build on, or contribute to.
