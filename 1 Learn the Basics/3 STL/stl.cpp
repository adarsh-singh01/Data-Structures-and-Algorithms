WHAT IS STL?
STL stands for Standard Template Library. It is a powerful set of C++ template classes to provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates that implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures like vectors, lists, queues, and stacks.
    It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators.
    It provides several generic classes and functions to make it easier to handle data structures and algorithms.

    4 TYPES OF STL COMPONENTS:
    1. Containers: Containers are used to store data. They are the objects that store
    2. Algorithms: Algorithms are used to perform operations on the data stored in containers. They are the functions that operate on the data.
    3. Iterators: Iterators are used to point to the memory addresses of STL containers. They are used to traverse the data stored in containers.
    4. FUNCTIONS: Functions are used to perform operations on the data stored in containers. They are the functions that operate on the data.
