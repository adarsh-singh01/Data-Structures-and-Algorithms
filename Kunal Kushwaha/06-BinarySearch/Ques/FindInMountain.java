/**
 * This program solves the LeetCode problem "Find in Mountain Array" (1095) using a simplified approach
 * that works with a normal int[] array instead of the MountainArray interface used on LeetCode.
 * 
 * A "mountain array" is an array where:
 * - Elements strictly increase up to a single peak.
 * - Then strictly decrease after the peak.
 * 
 * Goal:
 * Given such an array and a target value, find the index of the target.
 * If the target does not exist, return -1.
 * 
 * This solution performs the following steps:
 * 
 * 1. Find the peak index using binary search:
 *    - Since the array first increases and then decreases, the peak is the highest element.
 *    - Using binary search, we compare mid with mid + 1:
 *        - If arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1], we are in the decreasing part, so the peak is at mid or to the left.
 *        - Else, we are in the increasing part, so the peak is to the right.
 *    - We repeat until start == end, which gives the peak index.
 * 
 * 2. Perform binary search in the ascending part of the array (from index 0 to peak):
 *    - Use standard binary search since values are sorted in ascending order.
 *    - If target is found, return its index.
 * 
 * 3. If the target wasn't found in the ascending part, perform binary search in the descending part (from peak+1 to end):
 *    - Use modified binary search where comparisons are reversed since the array is sorted in descending order.
 *    - If target is found, return its index.
 * 
 * 4. If target is not found in either part, return -1.
 * 
 * This approach ensures an efficient O(log n) time complexity using binary search three times:
 * - Once for finding the peak
 * - Once on the left of the peak
 * - Once on the right of the peak
