create ur own datatype using classes(like a student class which has roll,marks,name)

class is a named group of properties and function( like a car).

class doesnt exist physically(car do exists but template stuff dont)
class is a logical construct
object is a physical reality

class is template of object
object is a instance of a class

when babies are born they are the instance of human class
human class is a rule provided by god...its not a physical thing...if u want to have a physical thing u need to have a baby


objects have 3 props...state,identity,behavior

we access the roll no of student1,2,3,4 by using dot operator/separator...bcoz dot connect the instance/object/class with instance variable
