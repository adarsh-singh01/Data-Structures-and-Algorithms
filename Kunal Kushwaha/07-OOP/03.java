/*
there are 4 OOPs concepts:
1. Abstraction: Hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality.
2. Encapsulation: Bundling the data and methods that operate on the data within one unit, e.g., a class.
3. Inheritance: Mechanism where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another class.
4. Polymorphism: Ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms.
